<h3>üíß Why Does the Water Cycle Occur?</h3>
<p>
The water cycle occurs because of the <strong>Sun‚Äôs heat</strong> and the force of <strong>gravity</strong>. The Sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing it to <strong>evaporate</strong> into water vapor. This vapor rises into the cooler atmosphere, where it <strong>condenses</strong> into clouds. Gravity then pulls the water back to Earth as <strong>precipitation</strong> (rain, snow, etc.). The water collects in different places and flows back into water bodies, starting the cycle again. This process is important for distributing water across the Earth and supporting all forms of life.

<h3>üå¶Ô∏è Explaining the Water Cycle</h3>
<p>
The <strong>water cycle</strong> is the natural process by which water moves continuously through the environment. It begins when the <strong>Sun heats up water</strong> in oceans, rivers, and lakes, causing it to <strong>evaporate</strong> and turn into water vapor. Plants also release water vapor into the air through a process called <strong>transpiration</strong>. This vapor rises into the atmosphere, <strong>cools down</strong>, and <strong>condenses</strong> to form clouds. When the clouds become heavy, the water falls back to the Earth as <strong>precipitation</strong>, such as rain or snow. This water then collects in rivers, lakes, oceans, or seeps into the ground as <strong>groundwater</strong>. From there, the cycle starts all over again, helping to maintain life and balance in nature.
