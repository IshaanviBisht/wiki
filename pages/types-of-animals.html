<h2>ðŸ“š Telegu Alphabets:</h2>
1. Animals with Backbones (We call them "Vertebrates" - say "VER-tuh-brates") <br><br>
These are the animals that have a strong, bony backbone running down their back, just like you!
Mammals: These are animals that have fur or hair, and mommy mammals feed their babies milk.
Examples: Dogs, cats, cows, elephants, even people like us!
Fun Fact: Whales and dolphins are mammals too, even though they live in the water!
Birds: These animals have feathers, wings, and lay eggs. Most of them can fly!
Examples: Sparrows, eagles, chickens, penguins (they don't fly, but they still have feathers!).
Fish: These animals live in water, have scales, and use fins to swim. They breathe with gills, which are like special underwater noses.
Examples: Goldfish, sharks, salmon, clownfish.
Reptiles: These animals have dry, scaly skin. They lay eggs, often on land.
Examples: Snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles.
Careful! Many reptiles like to sunbathe to stay warm.
Amphibians: These animals like to live in two places: water and land! They have moist, smooth skin. They usually lay their eggs in water.
Examples: Frogs, toads, salamanders.
Cool fact: Baby frogs (tadpoles) live in water, and adult frogs can live on land!
2. Animals WITHOUT Backbones (We call them "Invertebrates" - say "in-VER-tuh-brates") <br><br>
These animals don't have a backbone. They might have a different way to keep their bodies strong, like a hard shell, or they might be squishy!
Insects: These are tiny animals with six legs and usually have wings. Their bodies are divided into three parts.
Examples: Butterflies, bees, ants, ladybugs.
Spiders (and friends): These animals have eight legs! (Insects only have six). They don't have wings.
Examples: Spiders, scorpions, ticks.
Worms: These are long, squishy animals that don't have legs.
Examples: Earthworms, planarians (flatworms).
Snails and Slugs (and friends): These animals have a soft body. Snails usually have a shell they carry around, while slugs don't.
Examples: Snails, slugs, clams, octopuses (yes, octopuses are invertebrates!).
Jellyfish: These are squishy, bell-shaped animals that live in the water and have stinging parts.
Starfish: These animals live in the ocean and often have five arms, like a star!
