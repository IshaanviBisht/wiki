The Titanic, officially named RMS Titanic, was the largest and most luxurious ship of its time, built by the White Star Line in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
It was over 882 feet long, weighed 46,000 tons, and was considered "unsinkable" due to its advanced design and watertight compartments. 
On April 10, 1912, the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, carrying around 2,224 people from all walks of life‚Äîwealthy businessmen, celebrities, immigrants, children, and crew members. 
The ship boasted stunning luxury, including grand staircases, lavish dining rooms, a swimming pool, and even a gym, symbolizing the height of early 20th-century engineering. 
For four days, the Titanic sailed smoothly across the Atlantic. But on the night of April 14, disaster struck when the ship collided with a giant iceberg at around 11:40 PM. 
The iceberg scraped along the side of the ship, tearing open the hull and causing five of the ship‚Äôs 16 watertight compartments to flood‚Äîmore than it could handle. 
Panic slowly grew as passengers realized the ship was sinking. The crew began launching lifeboats, but there were only 20, enough for just over half the people onboard.
Some lifeboats were launched half-empty due to confusion and fear, and many third-class passengers were delayed by locked gates and struggled to reach the deck in time. 
As the ship tilted and the cold Atlantic water rushed in, people screamed, prayed, and clung to hope. The ship‚Äôs band famously continued playing music to calm the crowd, and many heroic acts occurred, with some passengers giving up their spots so others could survive. 
At 2:20 AM on April 15, the Titanic split in half and sank into the icy sea. Over 1,500 people died, most from hypothermia in the freezing water. Only about 705 people survived, rescued later by the ship Carpathia, which responded to the distress calls. 
The world was devastated by the tragedy. Investigations followed, and new maritime laws were introduced‚Äîships were now required to carry enough lifeboats for everyone, keep radios active 24/7, and follow stricter safety standards. 
The Titanic became a powerful symbol of human pride, technological overconfidence, and tragic loss. In 1985, the wreck was discovered deep in the Atlantic Ocean, 12,500 feet below the surface, with haunting images of broken staircases, cabins, and personal belongings lying in silence. 
The story of the Titanic continues to live on through books, documentaries, museums, and especially the 1997 film Titanic, which reignited interest in the ship's tragic story. 
Even today, more than a century later, the Titanic remains one of the most remembered and emotional disasters in history, reminding us of how even the greatest creations can be humbled by nature‚Äîand how human courage shines in the darkest moments.
